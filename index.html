                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>As someone who has always been interested in and influenced by creative media, I chose to pursue this as my career path.

                    <br>Starting in 2014, I studied Interactive Media Development at Confederation College in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Currently, I am in my third and final year of school and along the way I have expanded my skills and base of knowledge in a multitidue of areas.

                    <br>During my time in school, I have narrowed my scope of focus to the areas of Graphic Design as well as Photography/Videography, and this portfolio will provide a quick glimpse at the work I have accomplished in both fields thus far.</p>

            <br>

                <br>
                <p>This was a business card I designed to promote a fictional business ran by myself. The focus of this project was to design a card that not only provided someone with basic contact information, but to also use subtle imagery and typography elements to express what it was the business was about.</p>
                
                <br>

                <img src="img/moodboard_revised-02.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:430px;height:592px;">

                <br><p> During second year, students were placed into teams and assigned a real client in the local industry and were tasked with developing a guidebook intended to be used as a guideline to improving their current website. Seen above was one of the components I was responsible for, the "Moodboard". This asset is meant to give an idea of the intended tone, color scheme and overall intention of the business by using imagery to evoke feelings within the viewer.</p>

                <br><img src="img/album_art_1.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:500px;height:500px;">

                <br><p>One of my personal favorite assignments, we were asked to assemble a music playlist that conveyed a theme or told a story, which we would then use as inspiration to produce album artwork for said playlist. My playlist hinged largely on the theme of mortality and the linear nature life seemingly follows. I reperesented this theme through the usage of lines, typography, color and minimlistic form. This image is the cover art.</p>
                <p>Seen below are the other assets I designed for this assignment.</p>

                <img src="img/A_Brave_New_World_Final.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:430px;height:592px;">
            

                <br>
                <p>This assignment was an exercise in a variety of aspects. Once again, we worked in teams to design promotional artwork for a film developed by a student of the Film Production program at Confederation College. This project not only pushed us to complete a larger scale assignment with specific demands, but it also put us in a scenario where we were solely responsible for meeting with the client and drawing from our interactions with them to learn what they wanted, and how we could accomplish that.</p>
                
                <br>
                <img src="img/whiplash_poster.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:430px;height:592px;">
            
                <br>
                <p>Another assignment I thoroughly enjoyed, we were asked to personally select a film we enjoyed and design our own promotional poster for that film. I chose Whiplash, a gritty drama that focuses on the darker side of the competitive professional jazz scene. I used focused largely on color and usage of space, having a consistent pattern of red, white and black, and reducing clutter to place emphasis on the blood-stained drum in order to convey the intended theme of the film itself.</p>

            <p> This was a Public Service Announcement assignment which I shot with a fellow classmate and was responsible for editing the project in order to express a message related to a societal matter. We chose to focus on the hardships animals face in shelters and humane societies and why adoption should be considered when looking to bring an animal into your home.<p>

                <br>
                <p>During Photography class in Semester 2 of the IMD program, we were assigned to take photographs as part of a project that convey a consistent theme. The theme of my project was nature. This is one of my favorite photos taken during this time.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This piece was part of a project where we were asked to photograph objects of different textures and edit them in such a way that accentuated that texture. Using photoshop, I enhanced the shiny qualities of the marbles and darkened the background as well as removed distracting elements og the scenery.</p>
